# theodinproject
I decided to make something a little different to what the project asked me to do. Mainly because I wanted 
a little practice alongside challenging myself and getting a grasp of the basics more. So I made a Cipher that could encode or decode a message
along with returning the original message.

Upon looking at other solutions I chose a different route and decided to use map instead of numbers and this allows the user to write a message
with any chosen characters rather than just the alphabet.

It's very simple and basic but I am really proud of what I achieved.
